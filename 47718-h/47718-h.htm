<h2><a name="IN_SLIPPERED_EASE" id="IN_SLIPPERED_EASE">IN SLIPPERED EASE</a></h2>


<p>Just because <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span> is eminently representative
of all our national characteristics is he something of
a good old-fashioned Philistine in his domestic circle.
We find him, in his notions of home life, distinctly
partial to the cosy comfort that is associated the
world over with "The Englishman's Castle." He
enjoys the delights of his own fireside, the pleasures
of his table, the society of his womenkind, the casual
visits of his friends, no less, and perhaps much more,
than the formal functions to which the phrase "At
Home" is also applied.</p>

<p>"Mr. Punch at Home" is in a sense the complement
of "Mr. Punch in Society." It touches on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
musical evenings, dances, the social life generally,
but more particularly the domestic side of it&mdash;the
servant difficulty, the humours of the kitchen and
the butler's pantry. It gives glimpses of home life in
the country as well as in town; among the poor as
well as among the rich; in flats and lodgings as
well as in suburban villas and the mansions of the
West End.</p>

<p>John Leech dealt largely with the servant girl
trouble, but as many of his jokes were topical and
have lost most of their point with the passing of the
topic, and as others have an old-fashioned air with
them and are not so smart or so pointed as those by
later artists, preference has been given to the moderns.</p>

<p>There are many stylish men, but very few men

<h2>METROPOLITAN HOUSEHOLDERS'
CLUB</h2>

<p>We understand it is in contemplation to get up
a club for the purpose of endeavouring to improve
the quality of servants. The indifference of the
material is very much against the project, but the
effort is worth making. A few old housekeepers
have determined to set the scheme on foot by
offering a few prizes, of which the following is a
catalogue:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">For the Cook who has lived longest in one
place without including whole candles under
the general head of kitchen-stuff</p>

<p class="right">
<i>One pound</i><br />
</p>

<p class="hang">For the Nurse who has walked oftenest in
the Park without speaking to a Horse-guard</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Ten shillings</i><br />
</p>

<p class="hang">For the Housemaid who has remained longest
in a situation in which the cat has not been
in the habit of doing wilful damage to the
crockery</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Five shillings</i><br />
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" width="385" height="450" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><i>Lady (engaging a maid).</i> "Was your last mistress
satisfied with you?"</p>
<p><i>Maid.</i> "Well, mum, she said she was very pleased
<i>when I left</i>!"</p></div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p class="hang">For the Cook who has been the greatest number
of years in service without resigning her own
heart and her mistress's cold meat to the
devouring passion of a policeman</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Fifteen shillings</i><br />
</p>

<p class="hang">For the Nurse who has remained the longest
time in a place without mistaking the
children's linen for her own, and given the
baby the fewest private punches and
pinches</p>

<p class="right"><i>Seven shillings</i><br />
</p>

<p class="hang">For the Female Servant who has set off on
Sunday evenings to go to church, and found
her way there oftenest</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Five shillings</i><br />
</p>

<p class="hang">For the Page who has opened the smallest
number of notes in the longest period of service</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Half-a-Crown</i><br />
</p>

<p class="hang">For the Groom who has best carried out the
principles of protection with regard to his
master's corn</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Ten shillings</i><br />
</p>

<p class="hang">For the Footman who has worn the fewest of
his master's shirts</p>

<p class="right">
<i>One shilling</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The above are only a few preliminary prizes,
but if the scheme can be effectually carried out,
there is every intention to offer rewards for a
variety of other qualities. In the present day,
when servants are always "bettering" themselves,
which means growing worse and worse, the
project of a prize club for this troublesome class
seems fraught with the most promising prospects.</p>

<h2>LADY HELPS</h2>

<p>On this subject much nonsense has been written.
They are quite as suitable (perhaps more so than
otherwise) to the cottage as to the castle. The
cottage need not have a name spelt with a Celtic
series of dissonant consonants. A few hints may
be advisable to the numerous "Lady Helps" at
present in the market.</p>

<p>A Lady may efficiently help the mistress of the
household to snub her husband, by adroitly echoing
(and improving) the said mistress's remarks of a
personal character.</p>

<p>A Lady may help the Cook to produce an
original dinner, by suggesting fresh combinations,
which will make the said Cook indignant, and
even furious.</p>

<p>A Lady may help the Butler effectually, by
decanting the '45 port, and shaking it a little first
as you would Daffy's Elixir.</p>

<p>A Lady may help the visitors to the house by
reading all the letters that may chance to be
thrown aside, and taking advantage of any private
intelligence they contain.</p>

<h2>HOW TO GROW A PINK OF FASHION</h2>

<p>This Pink must be planted in the most aristocratic
soil. The mould should be the very mould
of form. It grows mostly in the open air, and
Belgravia may be looked upon as the great
nursery for these Pinks. Several favourable
specimens, also, have been reared at the theatres,
the Italian and French operas, and similar
fashionable forcing houses. It is met with in
great profusion at the balls of the nobility. The
latter specimen, however, cannot bear the daylight.
It is put into a hot bed the first thing
when carried home in the morning, and there it
remains closed up and almost dead until the
evening, when it just begins to lift its drooping
head. It is about twelve o'clock at night that it
is seen to the most blooming advantage. Your
Pink of Fashion is watered with a liquid called
champagne, and, if it is at all faint, a little piece
of chicken and ham, and a few crumbs of bread,
applied to the mouth of the delicate flower, will
revive it wonderfully. It is a very tender plant,
though it has been known to bloom for two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
three seasons. The greatest care, however, is
requisite to keep it from the cold, for its beauty is
so sensitive, that the slightest neglect will nip it
in the bud. The Pink is of several colours, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the white with a beautiful maiden blush is the
specimen the most preferred. This Pink usually
carries its head very high, and, though not
distinguished for any particular amount of scents,
still it is eagerly taken in hand in society for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
(s)talk. The Pink of Fashion is mostly single,
but cases of double Pinks have been recorded.
The double (or married) Pink, however, does not
excite one half the interest of the one that is
single.</p>

<h2>THE SERVANTS' COLLEGE</h2>

<p>Mr. Punch rejoices to hear that "the greatest
plague of life" has a slight chance of being abated
by the establishment of a College for Servants,
who will be educated in the most careful way to
do justice to their employers&mdash;the main idea being
that most lucidly stated by the Dean of Saint
Patrick's, that it is the chief duty of every servant
to ascertain the full amount of his master's income,
and to spend the whole of it on his own department.
Having been favoured with an early copy

commence, <i>Mr. Punch</i> is glad to give to this

<h2>THE MODERN WOMAN'S VADE MECUM</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> Do you agree with a certain female
lecturer, that it is the duty of the fair sex to
captivate the other?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Certainly, as cleverness need not be
divorced from fascination.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> You do not object, then, to brains in the
abstract?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; but as some men have a horror of
the blue-stocking, I would cover fine heads with
pretty toques.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And if a woman has literary tastes, what
would you advise?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That part of her reading should be devoted
to the fashion journals, and she should not
sacrifice her toilette to her intellect.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is your opinion about latchkeys,
visits to the music-halls, and cigarettes?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That, from a man's point of view, they are
played out, and consequently should be abandoned
by man's would-be help-mate.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What do you think of glasses?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That, when necessary, they should take the
shape of a pince-nez, as it is more becoming than
spectacles.</p>

<p class="center">PRELIMINARY CHAPTER</p>


<p>Betty, "first catch your fish," is a golden rule
for a cook, and first catch your situation is a very
necessary piece of advice to be given to servants
in general. The choice of a mistress requires as
much judgment as the choice of poultry; and you
should be careful not to pick out a very old bird
in either case. The best market to go to in order
to suit yourself is a servants' bazaar&mdash;as it is
called&mdash;where mistresses are always on view for
servants to select from. On being shown up to a
lady, you should always act and talk as if you were
hiring her, instead of wanting to be hired. You
should examine her closely as to the company she
keeps, and the number of her family; when, if
there is any insuperable objection&mdash;such as the
absence of a footman, a stipulation against perquisites,
a total prohibition of a grease-pot, or
a denial of the right of visit, by a refusal to allow
followers&mdash;in either or all of these cases, it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
as well to tell "the lady" plainly that you must
decline her situation. It is a good general rule to
be the first to give a refusal, and, when you find
you are not likely to suit the place, a bold assertion
that the place will not suit you, prevents any
compromise of your dignity. If you like the
appearance and manner of the party requiring
your assistance, but with some few concessions to
be made, the best way to obtain them will be by
declaring that you never heard of any "lady"
requiring&mdash;whatever it may be that you have set
your face against. By laying a stress on the word
"lady," you show your knowledge of the habits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of the superior classes; and as the person hiring
you will probably wish to imitate their ways, she
will perhaps take your hint as to what a "lady"
ought to do, and dispense with conditions, which,
on your authority, are pronounced unlady-like. If
a situation seems really desirable, you should
evince a willingness, and profess an ability, to do
anything, and everything. If you get the place,
and are ever called upon to fulfil your promises, it
is easy to say you did not exactly understand you
would be expected to do this, or that; and as
people generally dislike changing, you will, most
probably, be able to retain your place.</p>

<p>When asked if you are fond of children, you
should not be content with saying simply "yes,"
but you should indulge in a sort of involuntary,
"Bless their little hearts!" which has the double
advantage of appearing to mean everything, while
it really pledges you to nothing. Never stick out
for followers, if they are objected to; though you
may ask permission for a cousin to come and see
you; and as you do not say which cousin, provided
only one comes at a time, you may have half-a-dozen
to visit you. Besides, if the worst comes
to the worst, and you cannot do any better, there
is always the police to fall back upon. By-the-way,
as the police cannot be in every kitchen at
once, it might answer the purpose of the female
servants throughout London, to establish police
sweeps, on the principle of the Derby lotteries, or
the Art-Union. Each subscriber might draw a
number, and if the number happened to be that
of the policeman on duty, she would be entitled to
him as a <i>beau</i>, during a specified period.</p>

<p>Always stipulate for beer-money, and propose it
less for your own advantage than as a measure of
economy to your mistress, urging that when there
is beer in the house it is very likely to get wasted.
You will, of course, have the milk in your eye,
when proposing this arrangement.</p>

<p>Tea and sugar must not be much insisted on,
for they are now seldom given, but this does not
prevent them from being very frequently taken.</p>

<p>Having said thus much by way of preliminary
advice, we commence our guides to service with</p>


<p class="center">THE MAID-OF-ALL-WORK</p>

<p>On arriving in your new place you get from the
servant who is going away the character of your
new mistress. She has already had yours, and
you have a right to know hers, which, as it is
given by a domestic who is most probably discharged,
will, of course, be a very bad one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="450" height="321" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <p><i>Mistress.</i> "You wish me to take your notice,
Jane. This is very sudden, isn't it?"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Jane (blushing).</i> "Oh no, mum,
I've known 'im three days!"</p></div>
</div>

<p>When your predecessor has taken her departure,
your mistress may, perhaps, come into the kitchen
and tell you what you will have to do, or, at least,
a part of it. She will show you the bells, and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
you which is the house bell, which the parlour
bell, which the drawing-room bell, and which
are the bells of the different bed-rooms;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
but she will not tell you how you are to
answer them when they are all ringing at
once, which may occasionally happen. As it will
probably be late when you arrive, you will have to
carry up the tray for supper, when you will be
stared at, and scrutinised as the new servant, by
the whole of the family. Let us now look at your
wardrobe. Two of each article will be enough, for
if the washing is done once a week you have a
change; but if only once in three weeks, you must
contrive to supply yourself with the smaller
articles, such as stockings and pocket handkerchiefs,
from the family stock of linen.</p>

<p>As a maid-of-all-work, you have the great
advantage of being a good deal alone, and can
therefore indulge in the pleasures of philosophy.
You can light the fires, and think of Hobbes.
Fasten the hall-door, and recollect some passage
in Locke. Or broil the ham for breakfast while
wrapped up in Bacon.</p>

<div class="captionc"><p><span class="smcap">"Merely Mary Ann" Again.</span>&mdash;"Please, 'm, the fishmonger says
will you have it filtered?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>You should rise early if you can, but if you cannot
you must make up for it by hurrying over your
work as quickly as possible. As warm water will
be wanted upstairs, don't stop to light the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
wood, and set them all burning at once, when you
will have some hot water immediately. Run into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
kitchen fire, but throw on two or three bundles of
the parlour and open the shutters, light the fire,
cut the bread and butter, clean the shoes, make
the toast; and when this is on the table, devote
any time you may have to spare to sweeping the
carpet.</p>

<p>Now, the family having gone down to breakfast,
you may light the kitchen fire, and then run up
and make the beds. After which you may sit down
to your own breakfast, having previously, of
course, taken the opportunity of helping yourself
to tea and sugar from the tea-caddy.</p>

<p>You may now go upstairs, professedly to sweep
the bedrooms, but really to look out of window,
and if the street is a narrow one, talk to the
servant opposite. Besides, looking out of window
saves time, for you are able to answer the fifty
people who come to the door in the course of the
morning with hair-brooms, apples, carpets and
rugs, tapes and stay-laces.</p>

<p>Being in a new place, you will be naturally
curious to examine all the cupboards and drawers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
up-stairs, but do not be too inquisitive at first, for
you will have other opportunities for a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
rummage.</p>

<p>You will now come down to cook the dinner;
but, as this is another branch of service, we proceed
to tell you how to lay the table. Lay the
knives and forks, taking the latter from the plate-basket,
where they will be kept, though they are
probably only Britannia metal or German silver;
nevertheless, call it "the plate," as it will gratify
your mistress.</p>

<p>If the family should be addicted to display,
without means, you will have to set round doyleys
and wine-glasses, with a decanter containing a
remnant of British wine, which will not be touched,
but will be brought on "for the look of the thing"
every day after dinner. The time has now arrived
for your own meal, and make the most of it.
Secure all the tit-bits, and if you cannot manage
to get through the whole of them at dinner, put
away part of them for supper.</p>

<p>About this time the afternoon's milk will arrive,
and if you have beer-money you will take some of
the milk out for your own use, taking care to fill
up with warm water, so that you do not cheat your
mistress of her quantity. You will be in the

<p>On washing days there will probably be a
woman come to wash; and in the mutual confidence
of the tub, you will probably become very
friendly. You may, no doubt, be of great service
to each other, you in giving her bits of this and
that, while she may serve you by becoming the
agent for the disposal of your kitchen-stuff.</p>

<p>Do not fall a victim to low spirits, and above
all, avoid sentiment. A morbid-minded maid-of-all-work,
whose heart has been carried off in the
butcher's tray, the milkman's can, or the baker's
basket, is for ever lost. Never hang your affections
on a policeman's staff. The force is proverbially
fickle, and many a servant girl has pined
with a hopeless passion for one who has moved in
a superior station.</p>

She will, very likely, have to take everything at
once to everybody at once. She will be having
the first floor and the two-pair back clamouring
at the same time for the only tea-pot in the house,
while the parlour will be calling angrily for his
boots, which have been taken by mistake, to the
garret, who is writhing in intense agony for his
highlows.</p>


<p class="center">THE COOK</p>

<p>For ages it has been believed that a certain
wicked person sends cooks; but Johnson has
well observed, and so by the by have Smith
and Brown, that "if we had no cooks, we should
be as bad as cannibals."</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Giles.</i>&mdash;"Well, it certainly <i>do</i> taste better than the physic I be in the 'abit o' takin'!"</p></div>
</div>
<p>Cooks have always been the subject of sarcasm,
and Jones tells us that even in his day the wits
loved to give the cooks a good roasting. It is
said, moreover, that "too many cooks will spoil
the broth," from which we may presume that, as
the workhouse broth is the very worst in the world,
a great many cooks must have a hand in it.
Apicius was the first man who made cookery a
science, and he poisoned himself: no doubt with
his own cookery. He invented several sauces,
and was, in fact, the Roman Harvey. He is
believed to have been the first who added the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
trimmings to legs of mutton, and he took for his
motto the line in Virgil:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
"<i>At Regina gravi jamdudum saucia curâ.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p>because the luxury of <i>gravy</i>, <i>jam</i>, <i>sauce</i> and <i>curry</i>
are all shadowed forth in the quotation alluded to.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson was, according to Boswell, "a man
of very nice discrimination in the science of
cookery," and he was proverbial for his sauce,
which he dealt out to every one with the greatest
freedom. Boswell once asked him if he liked
pickles, when he said, "No, sir; the man who
would eat a pickle would pick a pocket."</p>

<p>Boswell adds, "I ventured to say he would";
and they wound up the evening with grog, which
Boswell, as usual, had to pay for; and it is thought
that the expression of "Standing <i>Sam</i>" originated
with Boswell having to stand whatever Sam
(Johnson) chose to call for.</p>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Parr was also a great
epicure, and liked his victuals underdone, from
which we have the expression Parr-boiling.
Milton loved his meat well dressed, and died with
a good thing in his mouth; but whether it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
morsel of philosophy, or something nice, has never
transpired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Having said thus much of the ancient and
classical who took an interest in cookery, we
plunge down stairs into the modern kitchen, and
embrace the cook of the present period.</p>

<p>On going to be hired, you will, perhaps, be told
there are no perquisites allowed. Don't stick
out about that, for if perquisites are not allowed
you must take them.</p>

<p>It is easy to say the meat makes no dripping,
and, of course, you can't account for it.</p>

<p>It is a rule in cookery to make the best and the
most of everything, and you will therefore sell
your kitchen-stuff at the marine-store shop that
will give the best price for it.</p>

<p>In some families the mistress of the house will
assist the cook; but she should have a sickener
of that as soon as possible. If she makes a pie,
spoil it in the baking; for if there is any truth in
the adage about "too many cooks," the lady of
the house should not be encouraged in making one
of the number.</p>

</div>

<p>Order is a great essential to a cook, who should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
keep everything in its place, taking care to keep
herself as snugly in her place as possible. Never
connive at dishonesty in others, but keep yourself
to yourself; for, if you rob your mistress, the least
return you can make is not to sanction others in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
doing so.</p>

<p>Never go into any place where a cat is not kept.
This useful domestic animal is the true servants'
friend, accounting for the disappearance of tit-bits,
lumps of butter, and other odd matters, as well as
being the author of all mysterious breakages.
What the safety-valve is to the steam-engine, the
cat is to the kitchen, preventing all explosions or
blowings up that might otherwise occur in the
best regulated families.</p>

<p>Having laid down some general principles for
the guidance of cooks, we give a few maxims that
cannot be too strictly attended to.</p>

<p>1. Keep yourself clean and tidy if you can. If
your fingers are greasy wipe them on your hair,
which thus acquires a polish.</p>

<p>2. When a joint comes down from dinner, cut
off what you intend for your supper. If cut while
the joint is warm, it does not show that it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
been cut. Relieve it also from all superfluous fat,
which will of course go into your grease-pot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">A Warm Welcome.</span>&mdash;<i>Distracted Hostess (to Uncle George, who
has arrived unexpectedly).</i> "Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad you have come! The
conjuror I had engaged hasn't turned up. So <i>you</i>'ll do some tricks
to amuse the children, won't you?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>3. If you want a jelly-bag, cut up an ironing
blanket for the purpose. The former is of course
wanted in a hurry, but the latter may be procured
at leisure.</p>

<p>4. When your dishes come down stairs, throw
them all into scalding water at once. Those that
are not broken by the operation may afterwards
be taken out, and put in their proper places.</p>

<p>5. Scour your pickle-jars, but empty them first,
if you are fond of pickle.</p>

<p>6. If you have been peeling onions, cut bread-and-butter
with the same knife; it will show the
multifariousness of your occupations, and perhaps
give a hint for raising your wages.</p>

<p>7. Let your spit and your skewers be always
rusty; or, at least, do not take the trouble to
polish them; for by leaving great black holes in
the meat, they show it has been roasted, which is
always better than being baked, and it will be the
more relished in consequence.</p>

<p>8. Never do anything by halves, except lamb,
which you must sometimes do by quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

never come this morning!"</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>9. If you are cooking even a sheep's head or a
bullock's heart, take pains with them, so that what
you do may be equally creditable to your head
and heart.</p>

<p>10. If you have a follower, or a policeman,
who likes a snack, cut it off each joint before
you cook it&mdash;for everything loses in the cooking&mdash;and
the disappearance of one pound, at least,
in eight or nine, may thus be easily accounted
for.</p>

<p>The above maxims will be sufficient to guide
the cook in her course of service, and we do not
add any receipts, for it has been well said by
Dr. Kitchener, or might have been said by him as
well as by anyone else&mdash;that he who gives a receipt
for making a stew, may himself make a sad hash
of it.</p>

<p>In bidding farewell to the cook, we would have
her remember that her control over the safe will
give her a peculiar influence over the hearts of
the police, and she must be careful not to enervate
a whole division, and leave a district defenceless,
by being too lavish with the blandishments of love
and the larder.</p>

<p class="center">THE LADY'S-MAID</p>

<p>Ladies'-maids are the rarest articles of female
domestic service, and being in the nature of luxuries,
are the best paid. They are to cooks and housemaids
what the pine-apple is to the <i>pomme de terre</i>, and
for this pine-like superiority of station many are
doomed to pine in vain. The statistics of female
service give us a million maids as the grand total, and
deducting three-eighths for servants-of-all-work,
two-eighths for cooks, three-sixteenths for housemaids,
and one-eighth for nurses, we have a
surplus of one-sixteenth for ladies'-maids, which
will be about a fair average.</p>

<p>Servants belonging to this superior class should
be able to read and write. It is a good practice
in the former accomplishment to read all the notes
sent to your mistress, and the little motto wafers,
now in use, seem invented to facilitate this
arrangement, for they never adhere to the
envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>You will probably have the charge of your mistress's
apartments. Never suffer anything to lie
about, and, therefore, you should pocket any trifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
that is left carelessly out of its place. I do not
mean to say you should become a thief, for, if
found out, you would lose your place, and your
character, but you must take care of a thing till it
is missed, and when it is wanted, it will, of course
be asked for. It is then time enough for you to
find it in some hole or corner, into which it has of
course got by accident. Your lady's dressing-box
will be under your care. See that the scent-bottles
are always well supplied, which you can
only ascertain by taking a little out of them for
your own use very frequently.</p>

<p>You should endeavour at all times to save your
mistress trouble by acting for her as much as you
can; and in order to do this effectually, you
should dress as much like her as possible. Order
about other servants just as she would herself,
and talk to tradespeople exactly as if they were
being spoken to by your mistress, of whom
you are the representative. Of course the
closer the representation you give of her, the
more exact are you in the performance of your
duty.</p>

<p>Some ladies'-maids are expected to mend their
ladies' clothes; but no lady, that is a lady, ought
to wear any clothes that have been mended. You
should try and persuade her to be of the same
opinion, by which you will not only save yourself
the trouble of mending, but you will come in for
many things much sooner than you could otherwise
hope to do. The author of the proverb,
that "a stitch in time saves nine," no doubt
thought himself very clever; but if avoiding
trouble is the object, it stands to reason that
though "a stitch in time saves nine," it must be a
greater saving still never to put a stitch in anything.</p>

<p>If your mistress will make you work at your
needle, put a novel on your lap, so that you may
read and work at the same time. If you are
asked to cut out a body, make a bungling job of it,
that you may not be asked to do the same thing
again. If you cut out anybody it should be the
lady's-maid next door, with which your ambition
ought to be satisfied.</p>

<p>Taking out marks from linen is an essential part
of the duties of a lady's-maid. Some practise
themselves in this art by taking out the initials of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
their mistress and substituting their own; but this
is a dangerous experiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>It is said in "Knight's Guide to Service" that
"when for the first time you stand behind your
mistress's chair to brush her hair, you may feel
that you are placed in a situation of high trust."
This, however, depends upon circumstances; for
if your mistress dyes her hair, it is a great mark of
her confidence to ask you to brush it. If she
wears false braids, she is, to a certain extent, in
your power; for, as the poet says&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Should she upbraid,"<br />
</p>

<p>you might betray her; but if she is almost bald,
and wears a wig, from the moment of your being
entrusted to stand behind her chair and brush her
hair, you may do what you please with her.</p>

<p>If, in the story of <i>Faustus</i>, <i>Margaret</i> had worn a
wig, and <i>Mephistophiles</i> had seen her but once
without it, the power of the fiend over her would
have been irresistible.</p>

<p>In your position of lady's-maid, many family
secrets will perhaps come to your knowledge. Do
not talk of them to your fellow-servants, which
would, in fact, be destroying your own valuable
monopoly. A servant who knows a great deal of
the family affairs cannot be cheaply parted with.
You will be secure in your place, and will therefore
be in a position to make the most of all its
advantages.</p>

<p>The little work we have already alluded to says,
that if the lady's-maid is depressed in spirits, "she
should open her mind to the friend, whoever it
may be, that got her the place." This friend is
usually the keeper of a servants' office, who would
have enough to do if she were made to bear the
infliction of all the unbosomings of all the discontented
servants she may have found situations for.
This mode of easing your heart would involve the
necessity of constantly running out, besides the
expense of an occasional omnibus.</p>

<p>Manners form an essential part of the qualities
of a lady's-maid, and making one's self agreeable
is the best mannered thing one can possibly
accomplish. This is to be done by praise, for
nothing is more agreeable to a lady than flattery.
However sensible your mistress may be, she is
sure to have a share of female vanity; and even if
she knows herself to be ugly altogether, she will
fancy she has some redeeming feature. If she
squints, praise her complexion; if that is bad, tell
her she has beautiful eyes: if she has a dumpty
figure, praise her face; and if her countenance is
as ugly as sin, tell her that her shape is exquisite.
Some people will tell you that sensible women
don't like flattery; but this you must not believe;
for, however sensible they are, they are pleased by
it, particularly when it is administered with so
much art as to seem not intended for mere compliment.
Very palpable praise is insulting to the
generality of ladies; but flattery can scarcely be
too gross for some few of them. You should study
the character of your mistress, that you may not
run the risk of offending her by too much praise,
or hurting her by giving too little. Your mistress
will sometimes take a journey, and you will then
have to pack her things for her. The following
directions for packing a lady's portmanteau may,
therefore, be of use to you:&mdash;Put the lighter
dresses at the bottom, for these will not be wanted
while travelling; and artificial flowers, wreaths,
&amp;c., may go along with them. Insert next a layer
of dress caps, and ram well down with heavy
dresses, to keep the others in their places. Throw
in a sprinkling of shoes, and then add the rest of
the wardrobe; cramming-in the marking-ink and
the desk at the top, where they are easily got at
if they are wanted. Thrust in scissors and hairbrushes
anywhere that you can find room for
them. Get the footman to cord the box, for it
will be a good romp for you, as well as great
assistance.</p>

that you have a tolerably snug place of it.</p>

<p class="center">THE NURSERY-MAID</p>

<p>Any one may undertake the place of a nursery-maid.
As every female has, when a girl, been in
the habit of carrying, letting fall, snubbing and
slapping, either her own or some one else's little
brothers and sisters, it is easy to say you have
been accustomed to children.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>Supposing that you enter service as a nursery-maid,
there will, perhaps, be an upper nurse, who
will be, in fact, your mistress. Your care at
home will be to wait on her; and when walking
out, you will have to keep the children at a
convenient distance while she flirts with her <i>beau</i>,
who will probably be one of the British soldiery.
This will be very tantalising to you at first; but
you must recollect that your own time will come,
if you wait patiently.</p>

<p>Some places are very different from others. You
may go into a wealthy family where the children
are kept upstairs, like live lumber, in the nursery,
and are only brought out now and then for show,
like the horses of the state carriage, or the best tea-set.
If you curb their spirits that they may be
docile on those occasions, and turn them out to
the best advantage as far as appearance is concerned,
you will be a favourite with your mistress.
In some places you will be what is called
"assisted" by the mother; or, in other words,
interfered with, just enough to destroy all your
attempts at discipline. In this case, your mistress
will doubtless tell you, that if you cannot
manage the children, she must find someone who
can, and will give you warning accordingly.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to give you any particular
directions about your dress, for the penny <i>Belle
Assemblée</i> will furnish you with all the latest
fashions; and you have only to do in cottons and
stuffs, what your mistress is doing in silks and
satins. You should bear in mind, that you are
not obliged to make yourself a dowdy to please
any one; for nature has doubtless given you a
pretty face, and the gifts of nature ought to be
made the most of. Besides, if you are a servant
at home, you are a lady out of doors; and you
may even keep a parasol at the greengrocer's, to
be ready for you when you take a holiday.</p>

<p>When you go to a new place, your mistress will,
perhaps, tell you the character of each child, that
you may know how to manage their different
tempers; but you will, of course, use your own
discretion. If one is pointed out as a high-spirited
little fellow, you may be sure that he is fond of
killing flies, tying toys to the dog's tail, striking
you, and crying, as if you had struck him, when
he hears his mamma coming. If you are told
that one of the dear boys has a turn for finding
out how everything is made, and he must not be
checked, as his papa intends him for a civil-engineer,
you may be sure that the juvenile spirit
of inquiry will be shown in pulling your work-box
to pieces, unless you turn his attention to the

<p>When you have a baby to take care of, some say
you should be particular in its food; but if the
child cries you have no time for this, and you must
stop its mouth with anything that comes handiest.
Indiscriminate feeding is said to lay the foundation
of diseases which remain with the child through
life; but as you do not remain with the child so
long, this is not your business. A nurse who
knows thoroughly what she is about, will keep a
little Godfrey's Cordial, or some other opiate,
always at hand&mdash;but quite out of sight&mdash;to soothe
the infant; for nothing is so distressing to the
mother, or such a nuisance to yourself, as to hear
a child continually crying. When there is only
one infant these soothing syrups must be cautiously
applied, lest the necessity for a nurse
should terminate altogether, and you are thrown
out of your situation.</p>

<p>An infant sometimes requires example before it
will take to its food, and, as it is very nice, you
may as well eat one half of it first, to encourage
the infant to eat the other. Use sugar in children's
food very sparingly, and, lest the infant be
tempted to want some of the sugar that is saved
out of the quantity allowed, lose no time in locking
it up out of sight in your own tea-caddy. If you
wish to save your beer-money, recollect that milk
is heavy for children, unless mixed copiously with
water. As nothing ought to be wasted, you can
drink what remains, instead of beer, at your
dinner.</p>

<p>There are many very troublesome duties that
some nurses undertake in order to amuse the
child; but as Nature is acknowledged to be the
best nurse, you had better let Nature try her
hand at all the hard work, while you confine
yourself to that which is easy.</p>

<p>When a child reaches a certain age it will begin
to want amusement, when, if there are no toys,
you may give it the poker and tongs, or set it down
on the floor before the coal-scuttle. Opening and
shutting a box is also an amusement; as it involves
occasionally the shutting in of the child's own
fingers, the operation combines instruction also.
As a child may be troublesome while being washed,
give it the powder-puff; and as every thing goes
to the mouth, the dear little thing will commence
sucking the powder-puff, which will keep it quiet.</p>

<div class="caption">
<p>This is not a feast of "funeral baked meats." It is a party of hygienic enthusiasts,
following the system by which all food is masticated eighty-five times and then allowed to
remain in the mouth till it disappears by involuntary absorption.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A very interesting age in children is when they
begin "to take notice." When taking a walk
with the children it cannot be expected that you
can always have your eyes on <i>them</i>, and you
must therefore accustom them to take care of
themselves as much as possible. Besides, self-preservation
is the first law of Nature, and a child
cannot too soon be taught to follow it. Thus, if
you are looking about you and the children get
into the road, while a carriage is passing, you will
probably not be aware of their danger, till it is
past, when you will begin slapping and scolding
your little charges that they may know better for
the future.</p>

<p>It is a very fine thing to encourage generosity in
children, and you should therefore talk a great
deal about the presents you have received on
birth-days and on other occasions from the little
dears in the place where you last lived. This will
of course give your mistress a hint as to what she
ought to do. For the children will naturally ask
to be allowed to make you presents, and the
parents not liking to check the amiable feeling,
and desirous of not being thought shabby in comparison
with your former employers, will no doubt
give&mdash;through the hands of the children&mdash;what
you may have occasion for.</p>

</div>

<p>If you have nephews and nieces you may supply
them with many little articles of dress that are pronounced
to be "past mending." If your mistress
notices that the stock of children's things diminish,
you can suggest that "things won't wear for
ever," which often passes as an apology for a
sensible diminution in the number of socks and
pinafores. You may observe that Master So-and-So
is such "a spirited little fellow, that he does
wear his things out very fast," and your mistress
will be satisfied if she thinks her child's spirit has
caused half his wardrobe to evaporate.</p>

<p>If you follow all these instructions to the letter,
you will make as good a nursery-maid as the best
of them.</p>

<p class="center">HOW TO MAKE OLD PICTURES LOOK NEW.</p>

<p>Many houses have pictures darkened with age
which only need a little drastic treatment to make
them as fresh and bright as new oleographs. The
surface should first be soaked in a strong solution
of hydrochloric acid and then rubbed with an old
nail-brush. Any paint that should chance to be
removed can easily be supplied by a local artist
for a few pence. We heard of a Sir Joshua
Reynolds which was treated like this the other
day in its owner's absence, and on his return was
mistaken by him for a Christmas supplement.</p>

<p class="center">TO REMOVE STAINS ON THE CEILING.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is to re-whitewash the
whole surface, which is done by lying on one's
back on the top of the bookshelves and dabbing
away steadily. But if the stain still shows
through it is best to spill water systematically on
the floor of the room above until you have stained
the ceiling uniformly, leaving it a russet brown.
After all, why should ceilings be white?</p>
